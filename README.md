# Bibliotheca Sundeliana

## Abstract

Bibliotheca Sundeliana is a web app that allows users to interact with a bible verse API to view any verse in the Bible, both in English and Latin. Users can also favorite each verse and view their favorited verses all at once. This app was a 4-day long showcase project through [Turing](https://turing.edu/) to showcase how my comfortability with React, data-fetching, and website-styling has progressed 3/4 of the way through the course.

### App Preview 
You can visit the live site [here](https://bibliotheca-sundeliana.netlify.app/).

## Goals: Building confidence with...
- Using React.
- Producing clean code
- Utilizing Router.
- Cypress testing, including: acceptance testing, happy and sad path user flows that require network requests.
- Deploying production web-apps


### Future Extensions
- Add a category to show verses by theme
- Add support for another language
- Make the UI color-changing dynamic based on another UI which brings in the church calendar's liturgical seasons

### Context
This project was completed during my fifth week in MOD 3 at Turing. It was a solo project, and the final project of the inning. It took me four days to complete. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html). The name is in reference to the famous [Bibliotheca Corviniana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheca_Corviniana), replacing Corvinus' name with a Latin derivation of my middle name.
